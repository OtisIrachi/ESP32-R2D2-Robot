ESP32 R2D2 Robot

This 3D printed robot contains two Microcontrollers,
one ESP32 D1 Mini and one ESP8266.   It can be controlled with
a phone and WiFi, or with a cheap IR remote.

Both Leg Motors are driven by N20 mini gear motors with an L298N Dual
Motor Driver Module (Amazon) and the Dome rotates using a 28BYJ-48 Geared 
Stepper Motor and a TMC2209 Stepper Motor Driver Stepstick.



A 7.4V 1300mA LiPo battery is used for power.
